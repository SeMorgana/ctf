DEFCON CTF Qualifier 2014: 3dttt

The challenge requires us to play 3D tic tac toe against a program running on the server, and I have implemented a minimax algorithm with depth being 2. In order to get the flag, we need to have an accumulative score higher than 50. Unfortunately, I did not record a video for this challenge.
